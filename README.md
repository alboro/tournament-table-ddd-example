Generate a tournament table where teams are divided into 2 divisions A and B.
In each division, teams play each other and, ultimately, the 4 best teams from each division go to the playoffs.
The playoff schedule is based on the "Christmas tree" principle: the best team plays against the weakest, where the winner goes further, and the loser drops out of further participation.
As a result, the winner is the team that wins all playoff games.
